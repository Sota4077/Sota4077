- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sota4077
- 👀 I’m interested in renewable energy, manufacturing, programming, videogames, music, hunting and cycling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write code in Python.  Eventually I want to create a garden that automatically waters itself.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaberate on anything right now.  I mostly want to learn how all this works and then I will dip my toes into collaberation or finding a way to contribute to a repository with the skills that I have.
- 📫 If you want to reach me you can find me by my username pretty much anywhere online.  Sota4077.
